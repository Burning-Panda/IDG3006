# IDG3006
This project contains all code written for both the backend and frontend of the application.
As of now, there seems to be a tiny bug with running express application, which will only run as a dev server.

This project will eventually be rewritten to become integrated into each other.

These two servers should be run separately, as they are not compatible with running together.
Please see the different ```README.md``` files located in both Frontend and backend folders for more information.
